"Overnight Sensation"

The sun is falling down outside the city walls
She's glowing like the cherry on my cigarette
Beaten sweater, diamonds dripping down her neck
I cannot take my eyes off her silhouette

Immaculate creation
Overnight sensation
God you really outdid yourself with this one
She's an overnight sensation

You look like you should be a centerfold
But I'm talking Playboy 1974
They sure don't make them like you anymore
Read between your tan lines, forevermore

Immaculate creation
Overnight sensation
God you really outdid yourself with this one
She's an overnight sensation

The sun is rising up outside this balcony
She's blooming like a flower laying next to me

Immaculate creation
Overnight sensation
God you really outdid yourself with this one
She's an overnight sensation
